(178, 2, '2015-11-16 20:17:24', '2015-11-16 20:17:24', 'Many employers offer <strong>group life insurance</strong> to their employees. For most people, it''s just another employment benefit they tick off and then forget about. Sure, it''s a benefit, but it''s not one many people normally think about.\n\n<h2>Understanding Group Life Insurance</h2>\n\nThe most important word in understanding the differences involved in group life insurance is the word "group." Everything about the policy applies to the group, not to you as an individual. <strong>You don''t even hold the policy in your own name, you are merely covered by it.</strong> Here are some points to remember.\n\n*Based on the group risk, not your individual risk\n\n*Usually no individual medical exam\n\n*Policy remains active as long as you remain in the group\n\n*Beneficial for high risk individuals because the risk is shared across the group\n\n<h2>Why Group Life Insurance is Never Your Perfect Solution</h2>\n\nYou shouldn''t just turn down your employer''s <strong>group life insurance policy</strong>, but it''s&nbsp;a good idea not to rely on it either. When you buy your own <strong>life insurance</strong> policy, you tailor it to meet your needs. If you need it to cover your <strong>mortgage</strong>, or your <strong>student loan</strong>, then you ensure you get a policy that does.\n\nGroup life insurance doesn''t give you that flexibility. It usually provides a fixed amount of coverage, from as low as $10,000 to perhaps $100,000. Alternatively, it may offer one or two years of your <strong>base</strong> salary. It''s a lot better than no insurance, but a lot less than your own <strong>term life&nbsp;insurance</strong> policy can offer.\n\nIt''s also imperfect because <strong>you cannot take it with you when you leave your job</strong>.\n\n<h4><strong>Now, you may say "What about portable life insurance?&nbsp;Can''t you&nbsp;keep that when you change jobs?"</strong></h4>\n\nWell, the truth of the matter is somewhere in between what you might want and what you might fear. Yes, if you have a <strong>portable life insurance policy</strong> on your employer''s <strong>group life plan</strong> you can convert it to an <strong>individual policy</strong> when you leave their employ. So in that sense, you can take it with you.\n\nHowever, what that doesn''t include is the fact that the converted individual policy won''t end up looking quite like the original.\n\nGroup policies offer low premiums because the risk is shared across the entire group, often including the employer. In many cases, the employer even subsidizes your premiums.\n\n<h4>When you convert it to an individual plan, all that goes away.</h4>\n\n*You no longer share the risk with the group\n\n*Your employer no longer subsidizes your premiums\n\n<strong>What all this means is that while your coverage may not change, your premiums will.</strong> In fact, your premiums are likely to skyrocket. You can easily end up paying a lot more money for coverage that doesn''t actually meet your needs. That''s not usually considered a good idea.\n\n<h2>So Should You Join Your Employer''s Group Life Insurance Plan?</h2>\n\nFor most people, the answer depends on the numbers. If the plan is sufficiently subsidized, it may cost you very little or no money to join the policy; in that case there really is no reason not to join.\n\nOlder people, along with some others,&nbsp;can also benefit from employer plans. If you are in a high-risk group, such as as being an older smoker, you may find the group policy is much more affordable than anything you could get on your own. In such a case, your group plan <strong>may</strong> be your best available option.\n\n<h2>Putting It All Together</h2>\n\n<strong>No group life insurance plan is ever a subsitute for your own comprehensive&nbsp;individual policy.</strong> It can''t be, it''s a "one size fits all" choice rather than something individually tailored to your unique needs. At the same time, it''s often a very good inexpensive supplement to your own more complete policy.\n\nNow in some cases, it may be your best choice. If that''s true for you, then it''s probably a good idea to take the policy they offer and then spend some time working out how to reduce your risk factors so you can get a better policy on your own.\n\n&nbsp;', 'Life Insurance Guide (Part X) - What About Your Employer''s Insurance?', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'life-insurance-guide-part-x-what-about-your-employers-insurance', '', '', '2015-11-16 20:17:24', '2015-11-16 20:17:24', '', 0, 'http://localhost:8771/nia/?p=178', 0, 'post', '', 0),

Insurance is all about statistics, and the better the insurance company''s numbers, the more accurately they can predict the future.\n\n<h2>The Key to Statistics</h2>\n\nThe most important thing to remember about statistics, is that while they do a great job of predicting the future of groups, they are almost completely useless for predicting the future of individuals. So while insurance companies can generally predict the <strong>average lifespan</strong> of people of any given age, they <strong>can''t predict</strong> the&nbsp;lifespan of any one individual&nbsp;in that group. They issue policies based on their best statistical information, betting that any given person will fall into the average of their group.\n\n<h4>Age and Statistics</h4>\n\n<strong>One result of this is that the younger you are, the easier it is to get insurance, especially for shorter terms.</strong> After all, it''s much more likely that a twenty-year-old will live another twenty years than a seventy-year-old. Insurance companies use this fact, along with your medical history, to determine your basic eligibility for any particular insurance policy.\n\n<h2>At What Age Do You Need Life Insurance?</h2>\n\nThere is no right or wrong age for life insurance. <strong>Anyone who has responsibilities to cover needs life insurance</strong>, regardless of their age.\n\n<h4>Younger People and Life Insurance</h4>\n\nYounger people are usually better served by <strong>term life insurance</strong>. It is generally simpler and easier to obtain, and is often a better fit for their needs. In most cases, these consumers know their financial responsibilities, and often buy their coverage to handle a specific obiligation. They often want insurance to cover things like student loans, their chidren''s educations, or perhaps their mortgage; term policies are perfect for this kind of expense because you can not only predict the amount, but also the duration of the obligation.\n\n<h4>Older People and Life Insurance</h4>\n\nWhile many older people can benefit from term life insurance, they are often better positioned to benefit from <strong>permanent life insurance</strong>. They can use it as part of a diversified retirement strategy, taking advantage of the existing and usually growing <strong>cash value</strong>.\n\nPermanent life insurance is a better fit for these people because their obligations don''t tend to have a pre-determined end date.

Needless to say, there is no one term that fits everyone''s needs, but there are definitely some guidelines you can follow that make it much easier to find the right length of term for your needs.\n\n<h2>Start With Your Needs</h2>\n\nThe first thing you should do before applying for any kind of <strong>insurance policy</strong> is make sure you understand your insurance needs. It''s the same with any major decision; if you don''t understand what you are doing and why you are doing it, it is very difficult to accurately determine what you need as opposed to what you only want.\n\nMost people buy term life insurance to cover specific <strong>financial responsibilities</strong>, such as paying off a car loan, or putting children through college. The advantage of these requirements is that they are simple to figure out. You know exactly when your last car or mortgage payment should be due, or the year your children can be expected to graduate from college. In those cases, figuring a term is easy.\n\n<h2>Consider Contributing Factors</h2>\n\nAfter the nature of your responsibilities, one of the most important factors to consider is your age. While&nbsp;many life insurance policies are <strong>renewable</strong>, that may not be the case for all policies, and your premium level may not be guaranteed on a renewal.\n\nFrom the insurer''s perspective, the biggest difference between a <strong>permanent life insurance policy</strong> and a term life insurance policy is that the company knows they are going to have to pay out eventually (so long as you keep up with your payments), which is not always the case with term life insurance. This makes term life insurance less of a risk so the company can offer more coverage for the same <strong>premiums</strong>.\n\nThe only issue is that as you get older, the chance the company will have to pay out goes up. Naturally, this also means that the older you get, the higher your premiums are going to be. It''s all about managing the company''s financial risk.\n\n<h2>What This Means for You</h2>\n\nIf you are a relatively young person, it often makes sense just to get a policy to cover the duration of your responsibility. A twenty year old with a three year car loan is fine with a three year policy just to cover paying off the car. However, as you get older, things begin to change.\n\n<h4>Higher Premiums</h4>\n\nIt&nbsp;may sound odd, but&nbsp;you usually get significantly lower premiums for a twenty&nbsp;year policy that you get at age forty than you would for a ten year policy you get at age fifty.&nbsp;After all, the company is likely to get more money from you with the longer policy because you''re making more payments. Do be aware your premiums are higher for longer policies due to the greater risk, but in most cases the age-related increase is more significant.\n\nNow one thing you do have to watch out for is that some policies have age-related premium increases, but those usually don''t come into play until retirement age.\n\nIn short, unless you know your needs are only going to be of a fixed duration, it''s almost always a good idea to get a longer term policy rather than a shorter one.', 'Life Insurance Guide (Part XIV) - How Long a Term for Term Life Insurance', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'life-insurance-guide-part-xiv-how-long-a-term-for-term-life-insurance', '', '', '2015-12-13 20:06:53', '2015-12-13 20:06:53', '', 0, 'http://localhost:8771/nia/?p=189', 0, 'post', '', 0),

Do be aware your premiums are higher for longer policies due to the greater risk, but in most cases the age-related increase is more significant.\n\nNow one thing you do have to watch out for is that some policies have age-related premium increases, but those usually don''t come into play until retirement age.\n\nIn short, unless you know your needs are only going to be of a fixed duration, it''s almost always a good idea to get a longer term policy rather than a shorter one.', 'Life Insurance Guide (Part XIV) - How Long a Term for Term Life Insurance', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '189-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-12-13 20:06:53', '2015-12-13 20:06:53', '', 189, 'http://localhost:8771/nia/189-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

A good insurance policy ensures that you are not caught out when certain <strong>unexpected</strong> costs arise. Nowhere is this more obvious than when it comes to your car.\n\n<h2>Car Insurance</h2>\n\nEvery driver needs car insurance. It protects you financially from the costs of accidents, enabling you to repair or <strong>replace</strong> your car following a wreck. Your policy generally provides a certain amount of coverage for medical costs, as well as an amount for your vehicle, and each figure is calculated separately.\n\n<h4>Your insurance premiums are calculated from several factors:</h4>\n\n*The make and model of your car.\n\n*Your age and sex.\n\n*Your personal driving record.\n\n*Where and how much you normally drive the car.\n\n*The amount of coverage you want to carry.\n\nAs a general rule, adult women have the lowest <strong>premiums</strong>, and young men the highest. Your state will usually require a certain minimum level of insurance, and if you have a car loan your bank will have its own requirements. After all, they want their money regardless of what happens to the car.\n\n<h2>What is Gap Insurance?</h2>\n\n<strong>Gap insurance</strong> is designed to cover you when your car is totalled and you still owe money on the vehicle. The reason it exists is that once your vehicle leaves the lot, its value is no longer tied to the amount of your outstanding loan. For some desirable vehicles, this is not an issue as they depreciate more slowly than you pay off your loan. <strong>For other vehicles, the value depreciates much more rapidly than the loan.</strong>\n\n<h4>A gap insurance policy covers the difference between the Blue Book value of your vehicle (what your insurer pays out), and the acutal amount you owe on it.</h4>\n\nFor example, if you owe $15,000 on your vehicle but the Blue Book value is only $10,000 you need to pay off the remaining $5,000 on the loan as well as come up with the money for a down payment on its replacement.\n\nGap insurance covers that $5,000 so you don''t have to.\n\n<h2>So Who Needs Gap Insurance?</h2>\n\nNot everyone needs gap insurance. For example, some Jeeps hold their value very well, so once you have paid off a few thousand dollars it will almost always be worth more than the loan. However, that''s not always the case for every vehicle.\n\nThe obvious answer is when you owe more than the car is worth, but not everyone knows the value of their vehicle, but there are certain guidelines that can let you know if you are more likely to need gap insurance than not.\n\n<h4>For the first two years of your loan</h4>\n\nNo matter how well your particular model holds its value, every car owner has to deal with the fact that your <strong>new car</strong> becomes a <strong>used car</strong> the moment it leaves the lot. At least ten to fifteen percent of the value vanishes instantly. Gap insurance covers that drop in value, so it is a good idea to hold for at least the first year or two to give you time to pay down the loan. This is particularly important when you have a longer than usual term, as the longer the loan, the more time it takes for you to build up value.\n\n<h4>If you drive a lot</h4>\n\nThe more you drive, the faster your vehicle depreciates, so if you drive a lot more than average, usually about 15,000 miles a year or 1,250 miles per month, you should probably carry gap insurance.\n\n<h4>If you have a model that is frequently stolen</h4>\n\nSome cars are more likely to be stolen than others, and thieves generally look for newer cars over older ones. This means that if your car is stolen it''s most likely to happen before you have paid down the loan enough to build up equity in the vehicle.\n\nIt''s always best to look into these things as soon as you can, because insurance is all about preplanning. The earlier you can prepare for something, the less likely you are to be surprised if it happens. You should never have to spend your downpayment on the next vehicle paying off the loan on its predecessor. A little careful planning and some gap insurance means you never have to.\n\n&nbsp;', 'Life Insurance Guide (Part XV) - Gap Insurance', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '191-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-12-20 18:37:12', '2015-12-20 18:37:12', '', 191, 'http://localhost:8771/nia/191-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

One of those questions is whether you should go with a single insurance vendor, or spread your policies among several different insurers. As with many other things, there is no single right answer for everyone, but there is usually a right answer for you.\n\n<h2>Benefits of a Single Insurer</h2>\n\nThere are a number of benefits that come from combining all your policies with a single insurer. For one thing, it''s much simpler to deal with one company rather than several. You only have one company to deal with, and often a single bill to pay. Best of all, many insurers offer a <strong>bundle discount</strong>, where you can save money by combining all your policies under a single policy umbrella.\n\n<h2>Benefits of Multiple Insurers</h2>\n\nOn the other hand, choosing to work with multiple insurers also has benefits. Not all insurers are created equal, and some carriers may offer better <strong>policies</strong> in one area than another. Going with multiple sources lets you take advantage of each <strong>insurance company''s</strong> strengths.\n\nSometimes, you can get better deals by comparing companies as well.\n\nSplitting your protection across different insurers also helps spread the risk as well, since you aren''t dependent on a single provider for all your insurance needs.\n\n<h2>Deciding Between Single and Multiple Carriers</h2>\n\nMany people don''t actually make a clear <strong>decision</strong> one way or the other. Rather than considering the competing benefits of the two approaches, they simply react. If they see a good deal from a new insurer, they jump on it; if their existing carrier offers them a bundle deal they may jump on that. Both approaches work, but it''s very difficult to get the best <strong>insurance coverage</strong> for your <strong>individual needs</strong> this way.\n\n<strong>Good decisions rely on good information</strong>, so before you decide which approach will work better for you, you need to inventory your own needs and priorities. That way you can actually make an effective choice.\n\nMost of the time, it is a matter of balancing simplicity against flexibility. Going through a single provider is easier. You only need to worry about one set of policies and it is much easier to manage. Choosing to go through multiple providers takes more time. You have to compare policies in detail, and master each company''s terminology. Still, it can make it easier to tailor your coverage to your needs.\n\nAs a rule, the simpler your insurance needs may be, the better off you are bundling everything through a single insurer. You can save both money and time, and the coverage should be fine for your needs. It lets you pay attention to your <strong>life</strong>, not your <strong>life insurance</strong>.\n\nOn the other hand, if you have more complicated insurance needs, you might really benefit from leveraging different kinds of coverage from different companies; getting <strong>term life insurance</strong> from one and <strong>permanent life insurance</strong> from another. It will take up more of your time, but your coverage will better fit your needs.\n\nIn the end, the most important thing is to take the time to sit down and figure out what&nbsp;your needs really are.

First, they all have a <strong>cash value</strong>, and second, none of them have a <strong>fixed term</strong>.\r\n<h4>Whole Life Insurance</h4>\r\nThe simplest form of permanent life insurance is <strong>whole life insurance</strong>. Its biggest advantage is its stability. Your premiums are fixed, as is the rate at which your <strong>cash value</strong> grows. It doesn''t grow very fast, but it always grows. It''s a very good choice for risk-averse policy holders.\r\n<h4>Variable Life Insurance</h4>\r\nWith <strong>variable life insurance</strong>, you can trade some of that stability for a greater potential reward.  As with <strong>whole life insurance</strong>, you pay a fixed premium.

With a universal policy, you can adjust both your premium and your benefit amount. You can even use your cash value to either pay off or reduce your premiums.\r\n\r\nThe trade-off is that in order to gain control in one area, you have to give up control in another. In this case, it''s rate of growth. With universal life insurance your cash value increases at a variable rate set by the insurance company.\r\n<h4>Variable Universal Life Insurance</h4>\r\nThe fourth kind, <strong>variable universal life insurance</strong>, takes elements of both universal and variable policies and combines them into one.\r\n\r\n<strong>Like a universal policy</strong>, it gives you control of your premiums and benefit. You can adjust either, and trade in cash value to reduce or pay off your existing premiums.\r\n\r\n<strong>Like a variable policy</strong>, you tie your cash value to the insurance company''s own investments, letting it rise and fall with them. It offers some risk, but also potential for growth.\r\n<h2>Choosing Between Types</h2>\r\nWhich type you choose, depends on your needs and your tolerance for risk.\r\n\r\n<ul class="listcontent">\r\n<li>If you are risk averse and don''t mind a relatively low rate of growth, a <strong>whole life policy</strong> may be your best choice.</li>\r\n<li>If you are willing to accept more risk for a potentially greater payoff, then consider a <strong>variable life policy</strong>.</li>\r\n<li>If you want a more hands-on approach, you can take control with a <strong>universal life policy</strong>.</li>\r\n<li>If you want the hands on approach, and don''t mind accepting a little risk for potentially greater reward, then try a <strong>variable universal life policy</strong>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\nRemember, there''s always a policy for everyone.

(129, 2, '2015-11-09 20:25:24', '2015-11-09 20:25:24', 'So now that you understand the basics of life insurance, it''s time to take a look at a few examples. Each example shows how people in different situations can get the greatest benefit from different life insurance options. Theory is always useful, but there is nothing like seeing choices in action to get a greater understanding of how things work.\r\n<h2>Example 1: Tanisha</h2>\r\nTwenty-two year old Tanisha has just graduated from college and is starting her first real job. She has no significant assets, and her only liability is a $25,000 student loan, which her parents co-signed so she wouldn''t have to work for her final year of college. With a good job, she plans to pay off her student loan within five years.\r\n<h4>Tanisha''s Policy</h4>\r\nTanisha''s policy is a 5-year term policy, starting at $30,000, to cover her funeral expenses and pay off her student loan. If she wants, she can take out a "decreasing term" policy where the payout reduces over time. This lets her take advantage of her steadily decreasing student debt to lower her premiums. She''ll have less insurance as the term progresses because she won''t need as much near the end as she does now.\r\n<h2>Example 2: Ellen</h2>\r\nEllen is thirty-three years old, she and her husband Noah have two children, Marcus and Portia, aged nine and ten. Both Noah and Ellen work. They have savings, but they also just refinanced their house for $300,000 over 25 years. They got a good interest rate, but they''re still paying almost $25,000 a year. With two incomes, this isn''t bad, but it''s too much for either Ellen or Noah to manage on their own.\r\n<h4>Ellen''s Policy</h4>\r\nEllen''s policy, and Noah''s for that matter, because they each have the same amount of coverage, is a 25 year term policy for $1.2 million. After paying off the mortgage, about $600,000, the survivor should have about $600,000 for other expenses including putting both the kids through college.\r\n<h2>Example 3: Richard</h2>\r\nRichard is 48, married, and has two adult children who are out on their own. He is in a good position financially with a solid retirement savings plan, but still owes on his mortgage. He''s also partially responsible for the care of his elderly mother, who is currently in an assisted living situation.

Each example shows how people in different situations can get the greatest benefit from different&nbsp;life insurance options. Theory is always useful, but there is nothing like seeing choices in action to get a greater understanding of how things work.\n\n<h2>Example 1: Tanisha</h2>\n\nTwenty-two year old Tanisha has just graduated from college and is starting her first real job. She has no significant assets, and her only liability is&nbsp;a $25,000 student loan, which her parents co-signed so she wouldn''t have to work for her final year of college. With a good job, she plans to pay off her student loan within five years.\n\n<h4>Tanisha''s Policy</h4>\n\nTanisha''s policy is a 5-year term policy, starting at $30,000, to cover her funeral expenses and pay off her student loan. If she wants, she can take out a "decreasing term" policy where the payout reduces over time. This lets her take advantage of her steadily decreasing student debt to lower her premiums. She''ll have less insurance as the term progresses because she won''t need as much near the end as she does now.\n\n<h2>Example 2: Ellen</h2>\n\nEllen is thirty-three years old, she and her husband Noah have two children, Marcus and Portia, aged nine and ten. Both Noah and Ellen work. They have savings, but they also just refinanced their house for $300,000 over 25 years. They got a good interest rate, but they''re still paying almost $25,000 a year. With two incomes, this isn''t bad, but it''s too much for either Ellen or Noah to manage on their own.\n\n<h4>Ellen''s Policy</h4>\n\nEllen''s policy, and Noah''s for that matter, because they each&nbsp;have the same amount of coverage, is a 25 year term policy for $1.2 million. After paying off the mortgage, about $600,000, the survivor should have about $600,000 for other expenses including putting both the kids through college.\n\n<h2>Example 3: Richard</h2>\n\nRichard is 48, married, and has two adult children who are out on their own. He is in a good position financially with a solid retirement savings plan, but still owes on his mortgage. He''s also partially responsible for the care of his elderly mother, who is currently in an assisted living situation.

(162, 2, '2015-11-11 21:28:35', '2015-11-11 21:28:35', 'It''s a sad but true fact that not all insurance applications are successful. Sometimes, the company you just spent all that time researching chooses not to offer you a policy. While rejection never feels good, it''s neither the end of the world, nor the end of the road.\n\n<h2>Don''t Forget to Re-Apply</h2>\n\nIt''s important to remember that not all insurance companies weight everything equally. So just because one company rejected your application does not mean that every other company will. Not only do different companies have different standards, but they also have different tolerance for risk. For example, one company may be more tolerant of diabetes than another.\n\nMany insurance brokers know which companies&nbsp;are better for a given condition, so they can help you determine which company is best suited for your particular circumstances.\n\nBest of all, if you re-apply quickly, you may be able to use the same medical examination for your second application, which can save both money and time.<strong></strong><em></em>\n\n<h2>Why Companies Reject Applications</h2>\n\nThe majority of life insurance application rejections are for medical or health-related reasons. The company is risking its money against your survival, so of course your health is of paramount importance.\n\n<h4>Health Reasons Why Companies Reject Applications</h4>\n\nLife insurance companies can reject your application for a host of reasons, often in combination. Here are some of the more common ones:\n\n<strong>*Because You Smoke</strong>\n\n<strong>*Your Weight</strong>\n\n<strong>*Pre-Existing Medical Conditions (such as Diabetes)</strong>\n\n<strong>*Drug Use (including Alcohol)</strong>\n\n<h4>Things You Can Do About It</h4>\n\nThe simplest thing you can do to increase your chance of having your insurance application approved is to <strong>quit smoking</strong>. This one step will do more than anything else for you.\n\nYou can also take the following steps:\n\n<strong>*Lose Weight</strong>\n\n<strong>*Exercise</strong>\n\n<strong>*Treat Any Pre-Existing Conditions</strong>\n\nEverything you can do to improve your overall health helps. There is a big difference in risk factor&nbsp;between controlled and uncontrolled diabetes.\n\n<h2>What Not To Do</h2>\n\nThe most important thing to remember when you re-apply for life insurance is to <strong>tell the truth</strong> about any medical and health conditions. Not only does sending false information invalidate your policy, it can also put you on a black list, and then you may find yourself unable to get life insurance from any provider.

Sometimes, the company you just spent all that time researching chooses not to offer you a policy. While rejection never feels good, it''s neither the end of the world, nor the end of the road.\n\n<h2>Don''t Forget to Re-Apply</h2>\n\nIt''s important to remember that not all insurance companies weight everything equally. So just because one company rejected your application does not mean that every other company will. Not only do different companies have different standards, but they also have different tolerance for risk. For example, one company may be more tolerant of diabetes than another.\n\nMany insurance brokers know which companies&nbsp;are better for a given condition, so they can help you determine which company is best suited for your particular circumstances.\n\nBest of all, if you re-apply quickly, you may be able to use the same medical examination for your second application, which can save both money and time.<strong></strong><em></em>\n\n<h2>Why Companies Reject Applications</h2>\n\nThe majority of life insurance application rejections are for medical or health-related reasons. The company is risking its money against your survival, so of course your health is of paramount importance.\n\n<h4>Health Reasons Why Companies Reject Applications</h4>\n\nLife insurance companies can reject your application for a host of reasons, often in combination. Here are some of the more common ones:\n\n<strong>*Because You Smoke</strong>\n\n<strong>*Your Weight</strong>\n\n<strong>*Pre-Existing Medical Conditions (such as Diabetes)</strong>\n\n<strong>*Drug Use (including Alcohol)</strong>\n\n<h4>Things You Can Do About It</h4>\n\nThe simplest thing you can do to increase your chance of having your insurance application approved is to <strong>quit smoking</strong>. This one step will do more than anything else for you.\n\nYou can also take the following steps:\n\n<strong>*Lose Weight</strong>\n\n<strong>*Exercise</strong>\n\n<strong>*Treat Any Pre-Existing Conditions</strong>\n\nEverything you can do to improve your overall health helps. There is a big difference in risk factor&nbsp;between controlled and uncontrolled diabetes.\n\n<h2>What Not To Do</h2>\n\nThe most important thing to remember when you re-apply for life insurance is to <strong>tell the truth</strong> about any medical and health conditions. Not only does sending false information invalidate your policy, it can also put you on a black list, and then you may find yourself unable to get life insurance from any provider. It simply isn''t worth it.\n\n<h2>What If They Still Say No</h2>\n\nIf you apply to several insurance companies, and they all turn you down, then it''s time to take a deeper look at the problem.\n\n<h4>Option 1: Try a Different Policy</h4>\n\nAs with anything else, sometimes you have to change your sights.&nbsp;If you keep getting rejected, maybe you need to consider a smaller benefit, or perhaps a shorter term.

In addition to life and car insurance, it is also a good idea for most people to carry disability insurance.\n\n<h2>The Difference Between Disability and Life Insurance</h2>\n\nThe biggest difference between life insurance and disability insurance is that life insurance exists to help you take care of your responisibilities after you''re gone, while disability insurance exists to help take care of you.\n\n<h4>The Two Main Types of Disability Insurance</h4>\n\nThere are two main types of disability insurance, <strong>long-term disability</strong>, or LTD, and <strong>short-term disability</strong>. Both work essentially the same way. You pay regular premiums while employed, so that your insurance company will replace your income should you become unable to work. While there are a number of differences between the two, the basics are identical.\n\n<h4>Short Term Disability Insurance</h4>\n\nAs the name suggests, short-term disability insurance provides income replacement coverage in the short term. It generally starts paying almost immediately, but the benefit term is distinctly limited. It works if you break your arm, not if you have an injury that renders you permanently unable to work. In most cases, the benefits will last no more than six months at the most. It''s an immediate patch for the problem.\n\n<h4>Long Term Disability Insurance</h4>\n\nLong-term disability insurance is more of a way to deal with permanent or at least near-permanent disability. Unlike short-term disability, it takes a while for the benefits to kick in, but they also last much longer once they do. It''s a trade-off.\n\nSome long-term policies can take you right up to retirement age, while others only last a couple of years, so it''s worth the effort to take some time and learn exactly what kind of plan you have.\n\n<h4>Alternatives to Disability Insurance</h4>\n\nThere are two main alternatives to disability insurance: Self-insurance, and family resources. The first is simple, burn through your savings while you are unable to work. The second involves throwing yourself on the mercy of others, which has its own psychological costs.\n\n<h4>Benefits of Disability Insurance</h4>\n\nThe biggest benefit of disability insurance is that it provides a safety net. You can keep your savings and retirement plan even if you cannot work. It is usually less of an income than you would get from working, often capped at about 60% of your gross income, but it is also considered after-tax dollars, which can offset some of the difference. Finally, you have complete control over the money, with no restrictions.\n\n<h4>Drawbacks of Disability Insurance</h4>\n\n&nbsp;No matter how good your disability policy may be, it cannot substitute for a good life insurance policy because it ends with you do. There are also limits on what it will cover, and you may find yourself having to go back to work in a much lower paying field than you are used to depending on how the policy defines disability.\n\nGet one, but don''t forget your life insurance.\n\n&nbsp;', 'Life Insurance Guide (Part XII) - Disability Insurance', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'life-insurance-guide-part-xii-disability-insurance', '', '', '2015-11-27 19:46:42', '2015-11-27 19:46:42', '', 0, 'http://localhost:8771/nia/?p=183', 0, 'post', '', 0),

Insurance is all about statistics, and the better the insurance company''s numbers, the more accurately they can predict the future.\n\n<h2>The Key to Statistics</h2>\n\nThe most important thing to remember about statistics, is that while they do a great job of predicting the future of groups, they are almost completely useless for predicting the future of individuals. So while insurance companies can generally predict the <strong>average lifespan</strong> of people of any given age, they <strong>can''t predict</strong> the&nbsp;lifespan of any one individual&nbsp;in that group. They issue policies based on their best statistical information, betting that any given person will fall into the average of their group.\n\n<h4>Age and Statistics</h4>\n\n<strong>One result of this is that the younger you are, the easier it is to get insurance, especially for shorter terms.</strong> After all, it''s much more likely that a twenty-year-old will live another twenty years than a seventy-year-old. Insurance companies use this fact, along with your medical history, to determine your basic eligibility for any particular insurance policy.\n\n<h2>At What Age Do You Need Life Insurance?</h2>\n\nThere is no right or wrong age for life insurance. <strong>Anyone who has responsibilities to cover needs life insurance</strong>, regardless of their age.\n\n<h4>Younger People and Life Insurance</h4>\n\nYounger people are usually better served by <strong>term life insurance</strong>. It is generally simpler and easier to obtain, and is often a better fit for their needs. In most cases, these consumers know their financial responsibilities, and often buy their coverage to handle a specific obiligation. They often want insurance to cover things like student loans, their chidren''s educations, or perhaps their mortgage; term policies are perfect for this kind of expense because you can not only predict the amount, but also the duration of the obligation.\n\n<h4>Older People and Life Insurance</h4>\n\nWhile many older people can benefit from term life insurance, they are often better positioned to benefit from <strong>permanent life insurance</strong>. They can use it as part of a diversified retirement strategy, taking advantage of the existing and usually growing <strong>cash value</strong>.\n\nPermanent life insurance is a better fit for these people because their obligations don''t tend to have a pre-determined end date. You can know to the day&nbsp;when your mortgage will be paid off some twenty-five or thirty years in advance, but you don''t have that sort of advanced knowledge of how long your retirement is going to last.', 'Life Insurance Guide (Part VIII) - Age and Life Insurance', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '169-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-11-12 21:27:27', '2015-11-12 21:27:27', '', 169, 'http://localhost:8771/nia/169-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

That doesn''t mean you send off a payment the moment you get the approval; there are a few more steps before that happens, but it does set things in motion.\n\n<h2>What To Do When You Receive Your Approval</h2>\n\nThere are several steps you should follow between receiving your approval and actually making that all-important first payment. Some of them your insurer requires, others are just very good ideas. You have to follow some of them, but it''s in your best interest to follow all of them, not just the ones your insurance company wants you to.\n\n<h4>1: Review Your Policy</h4>\n\nThis should be obvious, but sometimes the obvious still needs a reminder before it gets done. Just because the underwriter approved you for a policy does not mean that they approved you for a policy exactly as you requested. Now sometimes, that''s exactly what it does mean, but other times it may be that the underwriter determined that your love for hang gliding, or perhaps your diabetes, kicks you up&nbsp;a risk category so they want a <strong>higher premium</strong>. They may also have offered you a&nbsp;different&nbsp;term or even amount of coverage.&nbsp;If that''s the case, you want to know it before you sign on the dotted line.\n\n&nbsp;If it''s only a little different, you may be best off going ahead with it anyway, if not you can always explore alternatives. At least, you can if you know about the changes.\n\n<h4>2: Check Your Classification</h4>\n\nWith the approval form comes your <strong>rate classification</strong>. This is the insurance&nbsp;company''s&nbsp;assessment of just&nbsp;how much&nbsp;of a risk you are. Different companies&nbsp;have different names, but they all have a similar system. If you have a really good classification, this information will be on your approval. If you happen to fall into the best class, often called something like Preferred Elite, or maybe Preferred Plus, you may want to increase your policy now since you are unlikely to be able to get a better deal.\n\n<h4>3: Accept The Policy</h4>\n\nNow you can accept the policy and you are ready to move on to the next stage. It may involve calling a broker, or dealing direct with the insurance company. It doesn''t matter, all you are doing here is saying "yes."\n\n<h4>4: Do The Paperwork</h4>\n\nShortly after you accept your policy, you will receive it, along with some important paperwork for you to sign and fill out. You want to keep a record of your policy, so print it out if you received it electronically. You also need to sign the papers and send them off. This signifies your <strong>formal acceptance</strong> of the policy and is the penultimate step toward activating it.\n\n<h4>5: Make The Payment</h4>\n\nThis is it, once you make the payment, you have successfully turned your approval into an <strong>active life insurance policy</strong>. You are now covered. Most companies offer several different payment options, from annual down to monthly. As a general rule, the fewer payments you have to make, the more you save. If you do go for monthly premiums, you may want to set up automatic payments so that you don''t miss one.\n\n<h2>After You Are Insured</h2>\n\nThe process doesn''t stop even after you are making your payments. Just as your insurance company cannot predict your future, neither can you. As time goes on, things change. You have kids, you pay down your mortgage. So, just as your life changes, your insurance may have to change to match it. That''s why it''s a good idea to do an <strong>annual review</strong> of your policy.\n\nSpend some time going over your policy so you can be sure that it still matches your needs.

For most people, it''s just another employment benefit they tick off and then forget about. Sure, it''s a benefit, but it''s not one many people normally think about.\n\n<h2>Understanding Group Life Insurance</h2>\n\nThe most important word in understanding the differences involved in group life insurance is the word "group." Everything about the policy applies to the group, not to you as an individual. <strong>You don''t even hold the policy in your own name, you are merely covered by it.</strong> Here are some points to remember.\n\n*Based on the group risk, not your individual risk\n\n*Usually no individual medical exam\n\n*Policy remains active as long as you remain in the group\n\n*Beneficial for high risk individuals because the risk is shared across the group\n\n<h2>Why Group Life Insurance is Never Your Perfect Solution</h2>\n\nYou shouldn''t just turn down your employer''s <strong>group life insurance policy</strong>, but it''s&nbsp;a good idea not to rely on it either. When you buy your own <strong>life insurance</strong> policy, you tailor it to meet your needs. If you need it to cover your <strong>mortgage</strong>, or your <strong>student loan</strong>, then you ensure you get a policy that does.\n\nGroup life insurance doesn''t give you that flexibility. It usually provides a fixed amount of coverage, from as low as $10,000 to perhaps $100,000. Alternatively, it may offer one or two years of your <strong>base</strong> salary. It''s a lot better than no insurance, but a lot less than your own <strong>term life&nbsp;insurance</strong> policy can offer.\n\nIt''s also imperfect because <strong>you cannot take it with you when you leave your job</strong>.\n\n<h4><strong>Now, you may say "What about portable life insurance?&nbsp;Can''t you&nbsp;keep that when you change jobs?"</strong></h4>\n\nWell, the truth of the matter is somewhere in between what you might want and what you might fear. Yes, if you have a <strong>portable life insurance policy</strong> on your employer''s <strong>group life plan</strong> you can convert it to an <strong>individual policy</strong> when you leave their employ. So in that sense, you can take it with you.\n\nHowever, what that doesn''t include is the fact that the converted individual policy won''t end up looking quite like the original.\n\nGroup policies offer low premiums because the risk is shared across the entire group, often including the employer. In many cases, the employer even subsidizes your premiums.\n\n<h4>When you convert it to an individual plan, all that goes away.</h4>\n\n*You no longer share the risk with the group\n\n*Your employer no longer subsidizes your premiums\n\n<strong>What all this means is that while your coverage may not change, your premiums will.</strong> In fact, your premiums are likely to skyrocket. You can easily end up paying a lot more money for coverage that doesn''t actually meet your needs. That''s not usually considered a good idea.\n\n<h2>So Should You Join Your Employer''s Group Life Insurance Plan?</h2>\n\nFor most people, the answer depends on the numbers. If the plan is sufficiently subsidized, it may cost you very little or no money to join the policy; in that case there really is no reason not to join.\n\nOlder people, along with some others,&nbsp;can also benefit from employer plans. If you are in a high-risk group, such as as being an older smoker, you may find the group policy is much more affordable than anything you could get on your own. In such a case, your group plan <strong>may</strong> be your best available option.\n\n<h2>Putting It All Together</h2>\n\n<strong>No group life insurance plan is ever a subsitute for your own comprehensive&nbsp;individual policy.</strong> It can''t be, it''s a "one size fits all" choice rather than something individually tailored to your unique needs. At the same time, it''s often a very good inexpensive supplement to your own more complete policy.\n\nNow in some cases, it may be your best choice. If that''s true for you, then it''s probably a good idea to take the policy they offer and then spend some time working out how to reduce your risk factors so you can get a better policy on your own.\n\n&nbsp;', 'Life Insurance Guide (Part X) - What About Your Employer''s Insurance?', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '178-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-11-16 20:17:24', '2015-11-16 20:17:24', '', 178, 'http://localhost:8771/nia/178-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

In addition to life and car insurance, it is also a good idea for most people to carry disability insurance.\n\n<h2>The Difference Between Disability and Life Insurance</h2>\n\nThe biggest difference between life insurance and disability insurance is that life insurance exists to help you take care of your responisibilities after you''re gone, while disability insurance exists to help take care of you.\n\n<h4>The Two Main Types of Disability Insurance</h4>\n\nThere are two main types of disability insurance, <strong>long-term disability</strong>, or LTD, and <strong>short-term disability</strong>. Both work essentially the same way. You pay regular premiums while employed, so that your insurance company will replace your income should you become unable to work. While there are a number of differences between the two, the basics are identical.\n\n<h4>Short Term Disability Insurance</h4>\n\nAs the name suggests, short-term disability insurance provides income replacement coverage in the short term. It generally starts paying almost immediately, but the benefit term is distinctly limited. It works if you break your arm, not if you have an injury that renders you permanently unable to work. In most cases, the benefits will last no more than six months at the most. It''s an immediate patch for the problem.\n\n<h4>Long Term Disability Insurance</h4>\n\nLong-term disability insurance is more of a way to deal with permanent or at least near-permanent disability. Unlike short-term disability, it takes a while for the benefits to kick in, but they also last much longer once they do. It''s a trade-off.\n\nSome long-term policies can take you right up to retirement age, while others only last a couple of years, so it''s worth the effort to take some time and learn exactly what kind of plan you have.\n\n<h4>Alternatives to Disability Insurance</h4>\n\nThere are two main alternatives to disability insurance: Self-insurance, and family resources. The first is simple, burn through your savings while you are unable to work. The second involves throwing yourself on the mercy of others, which has its own psychological costs.\n\n<h4>Benefits of Disability Insurance</h4>\n\nThe biggest benefit of disability insurance is that it provides a safety net. You can keep your savings and retirement plan even if you cannot work. It is usually less of an income than you would get from working, often capped at about 60% of your gross income, but it is also considered after-tax dollars, which can offset some of the difference. Finally, you have complete control over the money, with no restrictions.\n\n<h4>Drawbacks of Disability Insurance</h4>\n\n&nbsp;No matter how good your disability policy may be, it cannot substitute for a good life insurance policy because it ends with you do. There are also limits on what it will cover, and you may find yourself having to go back to work in a much lower paying field than you are used to depending on how the policy defines disability.\n\nGet one, but don''t forget your life insurance.\n\n&nbsp;', 'Life Insurance Guide (Part XII) - Disability Insurance', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '183-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-11-27 19:46:42', '2015-11-27 19:46:42', '', 183, 'http://localhost:8771/nia/183-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),
(191, 2, '2015-12-20 18:37:12', '2015-12-20 18:37:12', 'The whole purpose of <strong>insurance</strong> is to maintain your <strong>financial stability</strong>. A good insurance policy ensures that you are not caught out when certain <strong>unexpected</strong> costs arise. Nowhere is this more obvious than when it comes to your car.\n\n<h2>Car Insurance</h2>\n\nEvery driver needs car insurance. It protects you financially from the costs of accidents, enabling you to repair or <strong>replace</strong> your car following a wreck. Your policy generally provides a certain amount of coverage for medical costs, as well as an amount for your vehicle, and each figure is calculated separately.\n\n<h4>Your insurance premiums are calculated from several factors:</h4>\n\n*The make and model of your car.\n\n*Your age and sex.\n\n*Your personal driving record.\n\n*Where and how much you normally drive the car.\n\n*The amount of coverage you want to carry.\n\nAs a general rule, adult women have the lowest <strong>premiums</strong>, and young men the highest. Your state will usually require a certain minimum level of insurance, and if you have a car loan your bank will have its own requirements. After all, they want their money regardless of what happens to the car.\n\n<h2>What is Gap Insurance?</h2>\n\n<strong>Gap insurance</strong> is designed to cover you when your car is totalled and you still owe money on the vehicle. The reason it exists is that once your vehicle leaves the lot, its value is no longer tied to the amount of your outstanding loan. For some desirable vehicles, this is not an issue as they depreciate more slowly than you pay off your loan. <strong>For other vehicles, the value depreciates much more rapidly than the loan.</strong>\n\n<h4>A gap insurance policy covers the difference between the Blue Book value of your vehicle (what your insurer pays out), and the acutal amount you owe on it.</h4>\n\nFor example, if you owe $15,000 on your vehicle but the Blue Book value is only $10,000 you need to pay off the remaining $5,000 on the loan as well as come up with the money for a down payment on its replacement.\n\nGap insurance covers that $5,000 so you don''t have to.\n\n<h2>So Who Needs Gap Insurance?</h2>\n\nNot everyone needs gap insurance. For example, some Jeeps hold their value very well, so once you have paid off a few thousand dollars it will almost always be worth more than the loan. However, that''s not always the case for every vehicle.\n\nThe obvious answer is when you owe more than the car is worth, but not everyone knows the value of their vehicle, but there are certain guidelines that can let you know if you are more likely to need gap insurance than not.\n\n<h4>For the first two years of your loan</h4>\n\nNo matter how well your particular model holds its value, every car owner has to deal with the fact that your <strong>new car</strong> becomes a <strong>used car</strong> the moment it leaves the lot. At least ten to fifteen percent of the value vanishes instantly. Gap insurance covers that drop in value, so it is a good idea to hold for at least the first year or two to give you time to pay down the loan. This is particularly important when you have a longer than usual term, as the longer the loan, the more time it takes for you to build up value.\n\n<h4>If you drive a lot</h4>\n\nThe more you drive, the faster your vehicle depreciates, so if you drive a lot more than average, usually about 15,000 miles a year or 1,250 miles per month, you should probably carry gap insurance.\n\n<h4>If you have a model that is frequently stolen</h4>\n\nSome cars are more likely to be stolen than others, and thieves generally look for newer cars over older ones. This means that if your car is stolen it''s most likely to happen before you have paid down the loan enough to build up equity in the vehicle.\n\nIt''s always best to look into these things as soon as you can, because insurance is all about preplanning. The earlier you can prepare for something, the less likely you are to be surprised if it happens. You should never have to spend your downpayment on the next vehicle paying off the loan on its predecessor. A little careful planning and some gap insurance means you never have to.\n\n&nbsp;', 'Life Insurance Guide (Part XV) - Gap Insurance', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'life-insurance-guide-part-xv-gap-insurance', '', '', '2015-12-20 18:37:12', '2015-12-20 18:37:12', '', 0, 'http://localhost:8771/nia/?p=191', 0, 'post', '', 0);

While the money is supposed to be used for the specific purpose of paying your final expenses, the insurance company cannot limit how your beneficiary spends it.\n\n*It can be assigned directly to the <strong>funeral home</strong>.

It has benefits, but you have to be aware of your needs and what it doesn''t do before you make the decision.\n\n*It is relatively expensive. Because the insurance company knows they are going to have to pay out eventually, unlike with <strong>term life insurance</strong>, you generally pay larger premiums in proportion to the coverage you get with final expense insurance.\n\n*It will not cover any other financail responsibilities you may have incurred.

(229, 1, '2016-07-05 07:53:49', '2016-07-05 07:53:49', 'When it comes buying insurance, whether for your&nbsp;life, home, or car there are a number of different questions you have to ask yourself. One of those questions is whether you should go with a single insurance vendor, or spread your policies among several different insurers. As with many other things, there is no single right answer for everyone, but there is usually a right answer for you.\n\n<h2>Benefits of a Single Insurer</h2>\n\nThere are a number of benefits that come from combining all your policies with a single insurer. For one thing, it''s much simpler to deal with one company rather than several. You only have one company to deal with, and often a single bill to pay. Best of all, many insurers offer a <strong>bundle discount</strong>, where you can save money by combining all your policies under a single policy umbrella.\n\n<h2>Benefits of Multiple Insurers</h2>\n\nOn the other hand, choosing to work with multiple insurers also hajklhjklhjks benefits. Not all insurers are created equal, and some carriers may offer better <strong>policies</strong> in one area than another. Going with multiple sources lets you take advantage of each <strong>insurance company''s</strong> strengths.\n\nSometimes, you can get better deals by comparing companies as well.\n\nSplitting your protection across different insurers also helps spread the risk as well, since you aren''t dependent on a single provider for all your insurance needs.\n\n<h2>Deciding Between Single and Multiple Carriers</h2>\n\nMany people don''t actually make a clear <strong>decision</strong> one way or the other. Rather than considering the competing benefits of the two approaches, they simply react. If they see a good deal from a new insurer, they jump on it; if their existing carrier offers them a bundle deal they may jump on that. Both approaches work, but it''s very difficult to get the best <strong>insurance coverage</strong> for your <strong>individual needs</strong> this way.\n\n<strong>Good decisions rely on good information</strong>, so before you decide which approach will work better for you, you need to inventory your own needs and priorities. That way you can actually make an effective choice.\n\nMost of the time, it is a matter of balancing simplicity against flexibility. Going through a single provider is easier. You only need to worry about one set of policies and it is much easier to manage. Choosing to go through multiple providers takes more time. You have to compare policies in detail, and master each company''s terminology. Still, it can make it easier to tailor your coverage to your needs.\n\nAs a rule, the simpler your insurance needs may be, the better off you are bundling everything through a single insurer. You can save both money and time, and the coverage should be fine for your needs. It lets you pay attention to your <strong>life</strong>, not your <strong>life insurance</strong>.\n\nOn the other hand, if you have more complicated insurance needs, you might really benefit from leveraging different kinds of coverage from different companies; getting <strong>term life insurance</strong> from one and <strong>permanent life insurance</strong> from another. It will take up more of your time, but your coverage will better fit your needs.\n\nIn the end, the most important thing is to take the time to sit down and figure out what&nbsp;your needs really are. Do you just need enough coverage to pay off&nbsp; your car loan? Do you have a family to support? Sitting down with the answers to those question, and any other relevant information makes it much easier to make that decision.\n\nIt is your choice.
